# Linkedin-Job-Scraping-and-Analysis

# Project Background

Data analysis is a systematic review process that enables informed decisions to be made by transforming raw data into meaningful information. As data has become much more widespread and important in the digital world, the search for data analysts has also increased in recent years. Since data analysts need to have many skills and programs, in this project, we have converted Linkedin job postings into csv files by web scraping using "requests" and "BeautifulSoup" in Python to examine the most needed tools for the "Data Analyst" position in TÃ¼rkiye and then analyzed this data using Google Sheets.
